 This Flutter code defines a basic casino-themed app. It includes a welcome message and a placeholder for a dice game. The app's structure is built using Flutter's `MaterialApp` and `Scaffold` widgets, with styling and layout considerations. Customize the code to create your unique casino app.

 Customizable Message: The widget accepts a dynamic greeting message as a parameter.
 Styling: The greeting is presented within a container with padding, a blue background, rounded corners, and white text.

 Dice Rolling:

Generates a random dice roll result (between 1 and 6) when the "Roll Dice" button is pressed.
Win/Loss Indication:

Displays a message indicating whether the user won or lost based on their bet compared to the dice roll result.
Bet Amount Input:

Allows the user to enter their bet amount using a text input field.
UI Styling:

Utilizes containers with different colors for distinct sections of the widget.
Applies styling with rounded corners and padding for a visually appealing layout.
Dynamic Updates:

Utilizes setState to dynamically update the UI when the dice is rolled or the user enters a bet amount.
